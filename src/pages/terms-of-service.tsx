        <div>
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-bold">Binding Arbitration</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those
          Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU
          UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY
          TRIAL.&nbsp;The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
          American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for
          Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the&nbsp;
          <a href="http://www.adr.org/">American Arbitration Association (AAA) website</a>. Your arbitration fees and
          your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate,
          limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.&nbsp;The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
          documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
          statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
          award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the
          applicable&nbsp;AAA&nbsp;rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place
          in&nbsp;Davidson,&nbsp;Tennessee. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to
          compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
          enter&nbsp;judgment&nbsp;on the award entered by the arbitrator.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or
          prosecuted in the&nbsp;&nbsp;state and federal courts&nbsp;located in&nbsp;Davidson,&nbsp;Tennessee, and the
          Parties hereby consent to, and waive all&nbsp;defenses&nbsp;of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non
          conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such&nbsp;state and federal courts. Application of the
          United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer
          Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more
          than&nbsp;one (1)&nbsp;years after the cause of action arose.&nbsp;If this provision is found to be illegal or
          unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
          provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
          jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
          jurisdiction of that court.

        <div>
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-bold">Restrictions</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To
          the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is
          no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to&nbsp;utilize&nbsp;class
          action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
          representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
        </p>

          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 font-bold">Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding
          arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
          intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft,
          piracy, invasion of privacy, or&nbsp;unauthorized&nbsp;use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this
          provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
          falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
          decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties
          agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
